# 🖼️ Art Museum Visitor Analysis (Work in Progress)

* Analyzing visitor trends at the Metropolitan and Guggenheim Museums pre-, during, and post-COVID /Preliminary Title/ 
 
________________________________________

⚠️ **Note**: This is a work-in-progress SQL analysis project using educational, simulated data inspired by museum statistics. Some sections include idea comments or to-do notes. 

The purpose of these comments is to document my thought process during development and analysis. Final documentation is under development.

________________________________________

## 📊 Project goal - initial notes on my overall idea:

- To identify visitor personas (age, profession, gender, interests, etc.).
  
  
- To track the impact of COVID-19 on the attendance of cultural institutions and on this basis to draw a kind of conclusion about the sustainability of the need for culture in a dynamic in the negative sense of the word surrounding environment.
  
  
- To make a comparison between two leading museums in New York and on this basis to make an assumption about successful/unsuccessful strategies for cultural management, etc.

## 🗃️ Database structure

The relational structure contains 5 main tables:

- 'Museums' - data about museums
  
- 'Exhibitions' - exhibitions in museums
  
- 'Visitors' - visitor profiles
  
- 'Visits' - when and what was visited
  
- 'Covid_Periods' – periods separated as follows: before - during - after the pandemic

## 🧠 SQL analyses

-- This is just an example. This query aims to compare total visits across museums in order to understand which museum drew higher attendance overall

SELECT  m.Name AS Museum,  COUNT(v.Visit_ID) AS Total_Visits

FROM  Visits v
    
JOIN  Exhibitions e ON v.Exhibition_ID = e.Exhibition_ID    

JOIN  Museums m ON e.Museum_ID = m.Museum_ID    

GROUP BY m.Name;

## 📈 Visualizations
-- After filling all tables with data, I will add colorful and clearly descriptive pivot charts with elegant design



## 🚀 Technologies
- SQL (MySQL)
  
- Python
  
- Excel (Pivot Charts)
  
- Git/GitHub



## How to Run
1. Install MySQL and import create_tables.sql and insert_sample_data.sql.
   
3. Run analysis_queries.sql to analyze data.
   
5. Open pivot_charts.xlsx in Excel.
